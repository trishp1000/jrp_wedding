# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
I created my site for my daughter. She has a beautiful voice and during high school was very involved in all things musical. 
She would like to sing at weddings, so this is my start to create a site for her. The is the skeleton. I want to add links to 
some of her videos on Youtube, her fg, instagram, etc. and add the functionality to collect data from people who contact her.
It's a work in progress. Hopefully, I'll pass this semester and be able to continue.

## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1.  .main-heading
        I added this class so that the heading area would span then entire width of the page, to provide a container for the “columns” used for the heading text and so I could easily add a background image and style to my heading.

2.  .left side,
    .center, 
    .right side
        I added these 3 classes so that the middle section (JRP) heading text could be styled different from the rest of the text on the same line.
        I also wanted the text to “stack” on smaller devices and spread across the top on wider devices.

3.  .pic col
    .about col
        I added these 2 classes so I could “stack” the columns on smaller devices and display the columns side by side on wider devices.

4.  .main-body
        I added this class so that the main section would be in a container that would allow me to adjust the width. In this case, I did not want the main body to span the entire width of the page. It allowed me to set different maximum widths in my media queries.

5.  .vocalist
    .quote
        I was originally using the img tag to style the image of my daughter, but had change to using the 2 separate classes so that my daughter’s image and the quote image could have different styles.

6.  .phone
        I added this class so I could style the phone # to look like the input fields for name and email address.

7.  ::placeholder
        I used this pseudo class so that the labels for my input fields would be imbedded inside the input boxes.

8.  .inputBgOpaque
        I used this class to prevent the background color of my name and email input fields from turning (google chrome) yellow when the user allows Chrome to auto-fill the input fields. I googled this issue and found this solution.

9.  .main-footer
        I added this class so that the footer area would span then entire width of the page and so I could easily add a background image and style to my heading.

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. function name ex( animate() )
.. what function does ex( animate() is used to move the elements in the info div across the screen)

```
